This is where I store all my GreaseMonkey scripts that make my life a bit easier by automating frequent and repetitive tasks.

the easiest way of deploying these scripts will be to, download the zip.
install [ViolentMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag) extension, 
in the setting, click "Import from Zip",
now all the scripts will be added to the extension, 
now simply edit the scripts in the extension itself and add the required details.
enjoy.
